# Online Books Search Web App

> App is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) <br />
> Homepage (/): - http://18.237.158.166:3000/ <br />
> Search (/search):  http://18.237.158.166:3000/search <br />

### IMPORTANT NOTE: 
> This issue is due to the fact that **I don't have a Domain Name** (like www. OnlineBooksSearch. com) but it is fine, user can search for books from here(http://18.237.158.166:3000/search) and all the search queries are stored in database (MongoDB Atlas).
